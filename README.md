# Chat control OTP Shirt

Chat control consists of measures aimed at monitoring and regulating online communications under the guise of enhancing security or preventing illegal activities. These measures include the surveillance of private messages, the massive collection of user data, and the imposition of restrictions on digital communication platforms. While proponents argue that chat control is necessary for online safety, we believe that such an invasive system can potentially undermine the foundations of democracy.

We were inspired to create this t-shirt by comment that more or less said "At least we are going to have a European version of the RSA t-shirt...". While we would have preferred not to need such a shirt, we believe that wearing it is the only way to spread awareness about chat control, not only on the web.

We chose the One-Time Pad (OTP) algorithm instead of other encryption algorithms because it is a very simple and can be understood by everyone. No special mathematical skills are required to grasp its principles.

## Food for Thought

1. We never imagined, even in our darkest dreams, that Europe would become the next China.
2. With chat control, some individuals will be "more equal than others" (politicians are exempt).
3. Are all interests truly balanced?

## Next Steps

No one wants to wear unattractive shirts. We encourage you to improve the design so that people will want to wear it not only because the message is important, but also because the design is appealing.

Here are some ideas for variations:
    - A cyberpunk design (?);
    - Versions featuring other encryption algorithms;
    - National versions of the shirt: While we have only mentioned articles that are valid across all of Europe, feel free to replace some articles with sources from your Country's Constitution or other relevant documents.
